<p>First off sleep is important for the growth of the human body, even for adults that are done growing. If you hurt your knee it's not going to fix itself while you're moving and active. Sleep give a much needed a period of not moving. Your body uses this to do functions that you couldn't do while awake, like the aforementioned healing.  </p>

<p>If you're a bodybuilder then sleep is when your muscles grow better than before. When working out you are literally burning through  your muscle. You're hurting your body so that it will come back stronger. But it won't come back at all without the proper conditions. </p>

<p>Your body also needs that time to clean out all of the gunk that your body collected throughout the day. It cleanses your blood, it filters your liver, it washes the arteries and much more. Your body would die if you didn't get sleep. You would be in despair and  nothing would work. </p>

<a id="sleep-for-your-mind" class="anchor" href="#sleep-for-your-mind" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sleep For Your Mind</h3>

<p>Your mind needs sleep to function. It has to have a time when the constant barrage of stimulants stop. You would go insane very fast without sleep. As a science project, a 14-year-old boy decided to stay awake for as long as he could. Randy Gardner stayed awake much longer than what was good for him. He started to hallucinate, and couldn't tell the difference 
from his imagination to reality after a week. He collapsed from exhaustion after 14 days of being awake. He took a long time to recover, and even longer to return to his normal state of mind. </p>

<p>Sleep is also the  time that your body take to process the day. It stores the important events into long-term memory and throws out the junk. What did you eat for lunch 1 month ago, not important. And if something is really important, then you will dream about it. Talk about death? Have a nightmare about someone doing horrible thing to you severed body parts. Skydive? Dream about the things that could have gone wrong.</p>

<a id="why-it-should-be-your-favorite-thing" class="anchor" href="#why-it-should-be-your-favorite-thing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why it should be your favorite thing</h3>

<p>Sleep is an amazing thing and if you are not already convinced then let me give you a few more reasons. Sleep lets you have dreams,  it lets you have dreams (not "dream" dreams but accomplishment dreams), it lets you live, it skips through the night, it gives you energy, it lets you pass through the boring parts of the day (cat naps), it lets you have nightmares, and so much more.</p>

<p>I bring up that nightmares are a good part of sleep for a more personal matter. I love to be scared. I play horror games, I watch thrillers and endure nightmares. A nightmare is an almost real horror game. I wake up heart racing, watch a youtube video to cool my mind, and go back to sleep. </p>

<a id="in-conclusion" class="anchor" href="#in-conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>Sleep is an amazing thing that must be passed. it is the bringer of life the teller of death (in some religions) and the almighty body healer. I bet that your convinced that this is the most amazing thing, and some might already be asleep. let sleep take you in, and foster you. Bow to the almighty procrastination master. GO TO SLEEP!!!</p>
